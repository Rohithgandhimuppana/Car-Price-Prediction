# USED CAR PRICE PREDICTION

This project predicts used car prices using a machine learning model trained on real-world data web-scraped from Cars24. After cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, a regression model was built to estimate prices based on brand, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and engine capacity. The application is developed using FastAPI with a clean HTML/CSS interface for entering car details and receiving instant predictions. The final model and app are deployed on Render, showcasing end-to-end skills in web scraping, ML modeling, API development, and cloud deployment.
